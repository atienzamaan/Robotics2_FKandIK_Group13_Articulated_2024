# Robotics2_FKandIK_Group13_Articulated_2024

         This repository will serve as Group 13-Articulated, Midterm project in Robotics 2. This focuses on the Articulated Manipulator, providing an overview of the important characteristics such as calculating the degrees of freedom (DOF) and employing Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) Notation for the joint parameters. Furthermore, forward and reverse kinematics for joint angles and the position of the end-effector will also be tackled. To further clarify the concepts of how an Articulated Manipulator functions, more images, and descriptions are also included.
